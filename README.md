# Smart-Dustbin-Using-Arduino
This project presents a Smart Dustbin system designed to promote hygienic waste disposal through touchless operation. It is built using an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic distance sensor, and a servo motor, offering a simple yet effective automation solution for everyday waste management.

The system operates by continuously monitoring the proximity in front of the dustbin using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. When a person approaches within a predefined range, the sensor detects their presence and sends a signal to the Arduino Uno.

Upon receiving this trigger, the Arduino commands a servo motor to rotate and automatically open the lid of the dustbin. After a short delay—enough for the user to dispose of waste—the servo rotates back, closing the lid securely. This touch-free mechanism significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination and the spread of germs, especially in shared or public spaces.

## Key features of this project include:
Automatic lid opening and closing using servo control
Proximity sensing with an ultrasonic sensor for hands-free operation
Hygienic and user-friendly design
Arduino Uno-based control system for real-time responsiveness
Compact and energy-efficient setup suitable for home, office, or public use

This Smart Dustbin project highlights the application of automation and embedded systems in everyday life, making waste disposal more sanitary and convenient through affordable and accessible technology.
